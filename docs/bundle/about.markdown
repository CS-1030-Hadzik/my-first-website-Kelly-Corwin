The purpose of Kendo ("Way of the Sword") is to discipline the human<br>
character. The modern world doesn't need swordsman, but it does need people<br>
with moral sensibilities. Through  Kendo you mold the mind and body, and<br>
cultivate a vigorous spirit. It emphasizes a lifelong asperation to<br>
self-cultivate, respect others, to be courtious and sincere, and aim to<br>
making meaninful impacts on others so that they too may dothe same.
