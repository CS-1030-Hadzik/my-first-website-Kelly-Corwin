## Header 2

> You didn't come into this world... you came out of it. Just as an apple tree apples, the universe peoples, and you are one of those peoplings. You're not a stranger wandering through a foreign land. You are this place, its eyes, its thoughts, its wonderings about itself. Most of us were brought up to feel separate as though we're tiny egos trapped inside these bags of skin looking out at a world that's over there full of objects and others, but that is a trick of perception. An illusion of language and labelling. In reality, there's no line where you stop and the world begins. You are continuous with it like a wave is with the ocean. Look at a flame. Does it have a boundary, a fixed shape? It's a process, a happening, a flow. So are you, and you’re not a static thing. You are a verb disguised as a noun. A whirl of consciousness, feelings, memories, all shimmering like light on water. When you were born the universe didn't make a mistake. It wasn't trying to test you, fix you, or mold you into something better. It was expressing itself as you, and what a peculiar, delightful, and intricate expression you are.  – Alan Watts

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
